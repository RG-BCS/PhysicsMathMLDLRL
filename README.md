# Hi there, Iâ€™m PhysicsMathMLDLRL ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a physicist turned self-taught Machine Learning engineer passionate about bridging theory and practice.

- ðŸ”­ Currently building and deploying projects across Traditional ML, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Generative Models.
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation through self-studyâ€”starting with Learning Python to master the language itselfâ€”then diving into core texts like Hands-On Machine Learning, Deep Learning by Goodfellow, and a wide range of resources to go deep into machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.
- ðŸ¤– Projects include building a small GPT-2 style language model, several GAN variants (DCGAN, StyleGAN, CycleGAN), deep learning architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, seq2seq models with and without attention for neural machine translation, Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), customized implementations of traditional machine learning algorithms, and reinforcement learning agents applying algorithms like DQN and PPO.
- ðŸŽ¯ Focused on creating real-world applications grounded in solid mathematical and physical principles.

## ðŸ“š My Self-Study Journey

As a self-taught ML engineer, I have studied a comprehensive range of foundational and advanced books, including:

- *Learning Python* by Mark Lutz  
- *Introduction to Machine Learning with Python* by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido  
- *Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch* by Sebastian Raschka & Yuxi (Hayden) Liu  
- *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron  
- *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville  
- *Deep Learning with Python* by FranÃ§ois Chollet  
- *Advanced Deep Learning with Python* by Ivan Vasilev, Daniel Slater, Gianmario Spacagna, Peter Roelants, and Valentino Zocca  
- *Designing Machine Learning Systems* by Chip Huyen  
- *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Christopher M. Bishop  
- *Building Large Language Models* by Sebastian Raschka (2025)  

This rigorous self-study has equipped me to build projects spanning traditional ML, deep learning architectures including transformers, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, GANs, VAEs, reinforcement learning, and language models.
