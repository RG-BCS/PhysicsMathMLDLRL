# Hi there, Iâ€™m PhysicsMathMLDLRL ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a physicist turned self-taught Machine Learning engineer passionate about bridging theory and practice.

- ðŸ”­ Currently building and deploying projects across Traditional ML, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Generative Models.
- ðŸ“š Self-studied extensively with foundational books like *Learning Python*, *Hands-On ML*, *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow, *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*, and more.
- ðŸ¤– Projects include building a small GPT-2 style language model, GANs and their variants, CNNs, RNNs, seq2seq with and without attention for NMT tasks, Autoencoders, VAEs, customized traditional ML algorithms, and RL implementations.
- ðŸŽ¯ Focused on creating real-world applications grounded in solid mathematical and physical principles.

## ðŸ“š My Self-Study Journey

As a self-taught ML engineer, I have studied a comprehensive range of foundational and advanced books, including:

- *Learning Python* by Mark Lutz  
- *Introduction to Machine Learning with Python* by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido  
- *Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch* by Sebastian Raschka & Yuxi (Hayden) Liu  
- *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron  
- *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville  
- *Deep Learning with Python* by FranÃ§ois Chollet  
- *Advanced Deep Learning with Python* by Ivan Vasilev, Daniel Slater, Gianmario Spacagna, Peter Roelants, and Valentino Zocca  
- *Designing Machine Learning Systems* by Chip Huyen  
- *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Christopher M. Bishop  
- *Building Large Language Models* by Sebastian Raschka (2025)  

This rigorous self-study has equipped me to build projects spanning traditional ML, deep learning architectures including transformers, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, GANs, VAEs, reinforcement learning, and language models.
